**Topics**
-   **Host's Activities and Peterson Academy Courses**: The host, Yaron Brook, is in Scottsdale, Arizona, teaching courses for the Peterson Academy. He recently finished an eight-hour course on money and is starting another eight-hour course on trade and globalization. These are part of a series of five courses, with plans to propose more, potentially including one on Ayn Rand. He notes the significant work involved in preparing these courses and mentions that attendees receive a free year of Peterson Academy access. He also shares his upcoming travel plans to Europe for two months, where he expects to maintain a regular show schedule from a rented office.
-   **Gaza Conflict and Propaganda Campaign**: The discussion centers on the intensified campaign around supposed mass starvation and child malnutrition in Gaza. Yaron Brook asserts that this is an orchestrated propaganda campaign by Hamas, designed to pressure Israel. He identifies three key leverages Hamas possesses: the hostages (knowing Israel's priority to free them), their ability to terrorize Palestinians and divert aid (selling it for profit), and the West's gullibility in believing Hamas's narratives, often amplified by organizations like the United Nations, BBC, and Al Jazeera. He highlights a shift in public opinion, including among American Jews and Israeli newspapers, condemning Israel.
-   **Israel's Strategic Failures and Altruism's Impact**: Yaron Brook argues that Israel's slow offensive and willingness to negotiate with Hamas, particularly under pressure from figures like Donald Trump, has emboldened Hamas. He contends that Israel's decision to withdraw from negotiations and become more aggressive led to Hamas's intensified starvation propaganda campaign. He criticizes Israel for succumbing to international pressure to provide humanitarian aid, including daily 10-hour ceasefires for aid delivery and new water projects funded by the UAE. He attributes Israel's predicament to the ""overwhelming impact of altruism,"" which he believes makes the world turn against Israel for being strong and self-interested, especially as the memory of October 7th fades. He argues Israel should have acted decisively and quickly after October 7th, even if it meant sacrificing hostages and causing more immediate civilian casualties, to achieve a swift victory and avoid the current prolonged conflict and international condemnation.
-   **US Trade Policy and Tariffs**: The host discusses Donald Trump's new trade deal with Europe, which he views as a ""victory"" for Trump but a ""stupid"" economic policy. He explains that Americans will now pay a 15% tax on imports from Europe, a significant increase from the previous average of 1.2%. He clarifies that while these tariffs are not catastrophic for the U.S. economy, they are distortive, inefficient, and detrimental to productivity and living standards. He criticizes the random nature of the tariff percentages applied to various countries (e.g., 10% for the U.K., 15% for the EU and Japan, 20% for Vietnam). He notes that markets are reacting positively due to reduced uncertainty, but emphasizes that tariffs are an ""unmitigated evil"" that damage the economy for no good reason.
-   **Benefits of Globalization**: Yaron Brook extols globalization as an ""unequivocal good"" that massively increases the division of labor and raises the global standard of living. He uses the example of LeBron James earning more than Michael Jordan due to basketball's global market. He explains how globalization allows companies like Apple to sell to billions worldwide, leading to increased profitability and value. He also highlights globalization's role in exporting Enlightenment ideas like science, reason, and individualism, fostering entrepreneurship and knowledge dispersion globally, which he sees as a safeguard against a new ""Dark Ages.""
-   **Ideology vs. Conditions in Extremism**: In response to a listener comment, Yaron Brook strongly refutes the idea that ""conditions create extremists."" He argues that ideas and ideology are the true drivers of extremism, citing examples like Hassan al-Banna and Osama bin Laden, who came from privileged backgrounds. He asserts that the bad conditions in Gaza are a *consequence* of Hamas's extremist ideology and choices (e.g., building tunnels instead of infrastructure), not the cause of Palestinian extremism. He draws parallels to post-WWII Japan and Germany, arguing that humiliation and realizing one's wrongness, rather than improved conditions, lead to change.

**Why you should listen**:
This episode offers a strong, contrarian viewpoint on the ongoing Gaza conflict, arguing that Israel's strategic missteps and the pervasive influence of altruism have led to its current international isolation. Yaron Brook also provides a passionate defense of globalization and a critical analysis of current U.S. trade policies, offering listeners a clear, objectivist perspective on these complex geopolitical and economic issues. The episode aims to get the listener to understand how ideological frameworks, particularly altruism, can distort perceptions of conflict and policy, and to appreciate the profound benefits of free trade and global interconnectedness."
